
Here is a small example of how to use the CubeMapGen filtering library.
It takes 6 cube face input images, performs angular gaussian filtering on the 
images, and saves out the resulting cubemap mipchain face images.

The example and code is fairly self explanatory, and documentation on the 
functions available in this library can be found in the include files.  

Visual Studio .net is required in order to compile this example.
