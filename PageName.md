(Last note from Seb Lagarde: I am not able to contact Ignition anymore (the owner of the project), so I can't add new user. The project will likely be not update anymore.)

Despite the name (We know it can be confusing), this project is not maintain by AMD guys but by few people finding that it is convenient to keep this tools update with new features.
That's why we refer to it by the term "Modified Cubemapgen".

Sebastien Lagarde add some new features to the original cubemapgen which are describe on the following blog:

For original AMD cubemapgen documentation, please refer to the original AMD website. (http://developer.amd.com/archive/gpu/cubemapgen/Pages/default.aspx)

There can be other projects based on the AMD source code. We are not supported by AMD at all.
